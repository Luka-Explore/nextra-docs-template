# Creating Config folder 

This is the first step in creating your new project structure. In this slide, we will create a directory called config. In this directory, we will store the components needed for the project. Inside the config directory, you will create a config.py and a parameters.yaml file.

### Step 1 of 3: Create the config folder

In your home project directory, go to the terminal window and type the following:

```python showLineNumbers
$ mkdir
$ cd config
$ touch config.py parameters.yaml
```
The first line creates the folder, the second line changes location to the new folder, and the third 
line creates the files.

### Step 2 of 3: Populating config.py

Inside the empty config.py file, add the following code


```python showLineNumbers {10}
from pathlib import Path
# Directories
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent.absolute()
CONFIG_DIR = Path(BASE_DIR, "config")
DATA_DIR = Path(BASE_DIR, "data")

DATA_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

#Public repository for the datasets used in the Explore Data Science Academy
DATA_PATH = "insert_path"
```
In the DATA_PATH on line 10, you need to replace “insert_path” with the correct data path. The path is in John Doe’s jupyter notebook, see if you can find it.

### Step 3 of 3: Populating parameters.yaml

In this step you will add the parameters that are relevant to the functions that you create, such as data pre-processing, splitting data and model training. For now we will focus only on the random_state parameter.

Go to the parameters.yaml file, and add random_state: 42, as shown below

```python showLineNumbers
#config/parameters.yml
random_state: 42
```
